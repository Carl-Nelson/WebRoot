                W3Schools is a great resource as an introduction to everything needed to make good web sites/apps, and is a good reference even for experienced developers.
                The site has tutorials and reference material for all kinds of languages used in web development. Anyone doing web development will find this site useful.
                I use W3Schools as a reference for languages or frameworks that I don't use very often, like HTML, CSS, and Node. <br>

                <li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br>
                Stack Overflow is probably the most essential site out there for any developer, web or not. Like W3Schools, you've probably run into it already if you've ever
                googled for answers to a programming question you've had. Stack Overflow is a Q&A site where programmers will post questions and get answers from the wide
                community of other programmers who frequent the site. Usually you can search for your question on the site and find it already answered, but if not, feel free
                to ask away! I use this site for everything, but especially for answering larger questions like the right way to implement some feature or another. <br>

                <li><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">Mozilla - Web Technology for Developers</a><br>
                Mozilla has its own reference site for web developers, somewhat similar to W3Schools. They've got documentation for javascript, CSS, and HTML,
                and some web APIs, as well as tutorials. I use the site whenever W3Schools falls short, or when I'm looking for a more detailed tutorial, like when I was
                trying to figure out JS promises.<br>

                <li><p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a><br>
                The most popular front end framework in the world! Yes, this one's obvious, but so is W3Schools and Stack Overflow. Bootstrap provides all the CSS 
                so you don't have to write it! It's everything you need to make a modern-looking, responsive website with minimum effort. They also have a mountain of
                documentation for all the features you could possibly want to use.I'm not interested in front-end web dev, so I use it whenever I can, 
                and definitely would have used it on this page even if it weren't required.<br>

                <li><p><a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a><br>
                Similar to Bootstrap, HTML5 Boilerplate is a front-end framework that provides shortcuts for making a website. Unlike Bootstrap, H5BP comes with a
                whole template to build your site off of, following current best practices. It even comes with apache server configs for best performance. If you want,
                you can even switch out Boilerplate's CSS/JS for Bootstrap's with a little tinkering. You might be noticing a theme here, which is front-end frameworks
                that do things for you. Well, I love anything that lessens the amount of HTML and CSS I have to write. I guess my ideal web development 
                resource would be a front-end developer who does all this UI stuff for me.<br>

                <li><p><a href="https://webfieldmanual.com/code">Web Field Manual</a><br>
                This is actually a list of links to resources on everything you need to know for web development. From general best practices to references and guides
                to help you write good HTML, CSS, and Javascript, this site has it all! It's basically like this list, but far more comprehensive. I'll be using this a lot,
                or more accurately: I'll be using the linked material on this site whenever I want tips or a guide on how to properly do any element of web development. 
                At this very moment, I have a guide to git that I found in the Web Field Manual open in my browser.<br>
